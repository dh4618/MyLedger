# Ledger

A daily task app with goals, repeating tasks, presets, and keep-until-complete carry-over.
Ported off Claude Artifacts to a normal web app: React + Vite frontend, Supabase (Postgres) backend.

The app code is unchanged from the artifact version except for one thing: `window.storage`
was swapped for `src/storage.js`, which exposes the same `get / set / delete / list`
interface but talks to Postgres. That's the whole migration.

---

## Setup

### 1. Install
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Create the Supabase project
1. Sign up at supabase.com and create a new project (free tier is plenty).
   Save the database password it asks you to set — you won't need it for this app, but
   it's a pain to recover later.
2. Open **SQL Editor → New query**, paste the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`, and run it.
   This creates the `kv` table and — importantly — the row-level security policy that stops
   anyone reading anyone else's rows.
3. Go to **Settings → API Keys → "API Keys" tab** and copy the **publishable key**
   (starts with `sb_publishable_`).
   Then **Settings → Data API** for the **Project URL**.

   > Projects created before Nov 2025 may show a legacy **anon** key (a long `eyJ...` string)
   > under the *Legacy API Keys* tab instead. Either works — the app accepts both.

### 3. Configure
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.

The publishable key is designed to be visible in a browser bundle — but *only* because row-level
security is switched on, which is what step 2.2 does. Skipping that step would leave the
database open to anyone. Never put a **secret** key (`sb_secret_…` or `service_role`) in
frontend code; those bypass RLS entirely.

### 4. Run
```bash
npm run dev
```
Sign in with your email; Supabase emails a magic link. No password to manage.

---

## Deploy

```bash
npm run build
```

Then either:
- **Vercel** — push to GitHub, import the repo at vercel.com, add the two `VITE_…` env vars
  in the project settings. Every `git push` redeploys automatically.
- **Netlify** — same flow; build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`.

Add your deployed URL to **Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs**,
otherwise the magic link will bounce back to localhost.

---

## Add to iPhone Home Screen

Open the deployed URL in **Safari** → Share → **Add to Home Screen**.
It picks up the diary icon from `public/apple-touch-icon.png` and opens full-screen
(no address bar) thanks to the manifest and meta tags in `index.html`.

---

## Moving your existing data across

1. In the artifact version: **Manage → Export**, then **Download file** (or copy the text).
2. In the new app: **Manage → Restore**, paste the JSON, confirm.

The storage keys and data shapes are identical, so it transfers as-is.

---

## Notes

- Data model is deliberately simple: one `kv` row per key per user. `all-days` holds the
  entire day history as a single JSON blob, which keeps request counts low. If it ever grows
  unwieldy (many years in), splitting it per-year would be the natural next step.
- `src/storage.js` is the only file that knows about Supabase. Swapping to a different
  backend later means rewriting that one file.
